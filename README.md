It works only with IPv4!!! At some point, I got tired of manually checking all the parameters for the IP address and I decided to write this calculator. I would be glad if it would be useful to someone too.
This calc will help you determine the class of your IP and split it on Net id and Host id. Also support custom CIDR.
